\n Sail, who is the bodyguard of Kiran Gosavi, another witness who is currently absconding, further said that he heard Gosavi talking to one Sam D’Souza about \n making a demand of Rs 25 crore.

\n"...Let's settle at Rs 18 crore because we have to give Rs 8 crore to Sameer Wankhede (NCB chief probing the Aryan Khan case)," said Sail’s affidavit.
\n Soon after, the NCB’s Mumbai DDG Mutha Ashok Jain issued a statement denying the allegations. "An affidavit by Mr Prabhakar Sail, a witness, has come to my \n notice where he has given details about his movements and activities on October 2, 2021, the day when the crime was registered," it said.

\n "As he is a witness in the case and as the case is before the court, he needs to submit his prayer to the court rather than through social media if he has \n anything to say. In addition, there are certain vigilance related allegations against certain persons in the affidavit ''' , bg="blue", fg = "White",padx=23,pady=13,font="comicsansms 19 bold",borderwidth=3,relief=SUNKEN2
